# Speak Now (Taylor's Version) Vault

When the track list to Taylor Swift's 2023 rerecording of her third studio album Speak Now was leaked ahead of it's release, Taylor Swift did not release the "vault" puzzles seen alongside the previous rerecording rollouts (Fearless TV and Red TV). 

I thought it could be fun to devise puzzles on my own that could have led to fans being able to guess the titles or featured artists on the 6 "From the Vault" tracks (aka songs that were recorded for the 2010 Speak Now but didn't make the original cut).

I worked on these in June and July 2023, as it was also a refresher for myself on HTML, JavaScript, and CSS concepts.
